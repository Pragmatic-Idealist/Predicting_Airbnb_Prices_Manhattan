Data Science Project Using Regressions and Web-scrapping to Predict Airbnb Prices in Manhattan
Created a linear regression model for hosts and guests to maximize return on investment for rental spaces and maximize value while looking for short-term rentals, respectively. 

Web-scrapped Airbnb.com for listings data. Cleaned data and removed outliers. Created plots and heatmaps to find trends and relationships.
