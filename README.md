# Business Problem/Motivation

As a New Yorker who both needed a place to stay when I lived outside of Manhattan, and rent out the idle space of my apartment when I lived there, I frequently needed to use Airbnb to find short term housing and rent out my living room just to afford the rent!

This is a dual-sided problem that many New Yorkers and visitors to New York have. So I created a linear regression model that predicts the price of Manhattan Airbnb rentals and show which features of the apartment influences the price. So that hosts can maximize their return on investment on their idle space and guests find the cheapest accommodations given their needs.
